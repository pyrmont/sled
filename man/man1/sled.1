.Sh CONFIGURATION
Advent of Code does not exposes a proper API for tools like
.Nm .
As a result,
.Nm
interacts with the Advent of Code server using the session ID
of a logged in user.
To obtain your session ID do the following:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -offset 3n -compact
.It
log in to Advent of Code
.It
open your browser’s developer tools
.It
go to the Storage tab
.It
find the cookie named
.Ql "session"
.It
copy its value to a file
.El
.Pp
The path to the file containing your session ID should be passed
to
.Fl "-session" .
By default,
.Nm
will look in the current working directory at a file called
.Eo
.Pa ./session.txt
.Ec .
.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits
.Ql "0"
if exiting without error.
Otherwise the exit status will be
.Ql "1" .
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples all assume that the user has put a session
ID in a file called
.Eo
.Pa ./session.txt
.Ec
that is in the current working directory.
.Pp

.Ql "12345"
